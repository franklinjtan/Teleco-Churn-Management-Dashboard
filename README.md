# Telecom Churn Management Dashboard
## Business Problem
* Due to consolidation, increased consumer demand, market liberalization, and globalization, competition in the telecommunications industry has intensified, and customer retention has become a crucial factor for business success. Customer churn, which refers to the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company within a given period of time, can significantly impact the long-run revenue, growth, and profitability of a telecommunications service (“telco”). Now, more than ever, in order to gain a competitive advantage, telecommunications firms have to use data-driven approaches to deliver an exceptional customer experience that includes personalized content recommendations, optimized pricing, and programs to drive customer retention, satisfaction, and loyalty.
